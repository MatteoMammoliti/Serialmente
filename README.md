Serialmente is a desktop application that allows UserS to keep track of the TV Series and Films they've watched on the main online streaming platforms.  
The entire application was developed using **JavaFX** and relies on the **The Movie Database (TMDb)** API to retrieve titles and their information.

Serialmente lets you:
- Track the TV shows and movies you have already watched.  
- Search for new titles using the TMDb catalog.  
- Customize your viewing preferences.  
- Manage your profile, Watchlist, and your Favorite and Watched lists.
